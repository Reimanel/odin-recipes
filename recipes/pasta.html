    <br><h2>Here's what you'll need:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 oz(340g) box of your favorite pasta (penne, farfalle, or orecchiette are all great choices)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium shallot, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 bunch asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <br><h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta according to package directions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook until softened, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the asparagus and peas to the skillet and cook until tender-crisp, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked pasta to the skillet and toss to combine. Garnish with fresh parsley, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
    <br><h3>Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For a richer flavor, you can use mascarpone cheese instead of ricotta cheese.</li>
        <li>If you don't have fresh lemon juice, you can use bottled lemon juice, but be sure to taste the sauce before adding it, as bottled lemon juice can be more tart.</li>
        <li>To make this dish vegan, use vegan ricotta cheese and nutritional yeast instead of Parmesan cheese.</li>
