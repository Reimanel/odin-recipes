    <br><h1>Ingredients:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 cup milk chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 cup white chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <br><h1>Instructions:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla.</li>
        <li>Gradually add dry ingredients to wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Do not overmix.</li>
        <li>Fold in chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Drop tablespoons of dough onto prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches of space between them.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Let cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
    <br><h2>Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For a chewier cookie, bake for a minute or two less. For a crispier cookie, bake for a minute or two longer.</li>
        <li>You can use any type of chocolate chips you like. Try mixing in some chopped nuts or dried fruit for a different flavor.</li>
        <li>If you don't have parchment paper, you can grease the baking sheets lightly with butter or cooking spray.</li>
        <li>These cookies are best enjoyed fresh out of the oven, but they can also be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.</li>
