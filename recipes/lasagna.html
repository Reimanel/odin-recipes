    <br><h2>Here's what you'll need:</h2>
    <h3>For the Sausage Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage, casings removed</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <br><h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Make the Sausage Sauce: Heat olive oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium heat. <br> Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. 
        Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds more.</li>
        <li>Add sausage and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned. Drain any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, salt, and pepper. <br> Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna: Spread 1/3 of the sausage sauce on the bottom of the skillet. Top with 4 lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, and parsley. Spread 1/2 of the ricotta mixture over the noodles. <br> Top with another 1/3 of the sausage sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers with 4 more noodles, remaining ricotta mixture, and 1/3 of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Top with remaining noodles and sauce. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over the top.</li>
        <li>Cover the skillet tightly with foil and bake for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Uncover and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For a richer flavor, you can use mascarpone cheese instead of ricotta cheese.</li>
        <li>If you don't have fresh parsley, you can use 1 teaspoon dried parsley.</li>
        <li>To make this dish vegetarian, use plant-based sausage crumbles instead of Italian sausage.</li>
        <li>To make this dish vegan, use vegan ricotta cheese and nutritional yeast instead of Parmesan cheese.</li>
