    <br><h1>Ingredients:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup tapioca flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>
    <br><h1>Instructions:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together tapioca flour, Parmesan cheese, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, heat oil and milk over medium heat until just simmering. Do not boil.</li>
        <li>Pour hot milk mixture into the dry ingredients and stir quickly until a thick dough forms.</li>
        <li>Let dough cool slightly for about 5 minutes. Then, stir in the egg until fully incorporated.</li>
        <li>Drop tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch of space between them.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and puffed.</li>
        <li>Let cool slightly before serving. Enjoy warm!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For a chewier Pão de Queijo, use less milk. For a lighter and airier Pão de Queijo, use more milk.</li>
        <li>You can add other ingredients to your Pão de Queijo dough, such as chopped ham, shredded chicken, or finely chopped vegetables.</li>
        <li>Pão de Queijo is best enjoyed fresh out of the oven, but they can also be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.</li>
        <li>Use the right type of tapioca flour. Not all tapioca flours are created equal. 
            <br>For Pão de Queijo, you need to use tapioca starch, also known as tapioca flour or fécula de tapioca. Avoid using tapioca pearls, which are not the same thing.</li>
        <li>Don't overmix the dough. Overmixing the dough will make your Pão de Queijo tough. Mix the dough just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li>Let the dough rest. After you add the egg to the dough, let it rest for a few minutes before baking. 
            <br>This will allow the tapioca flour to absorb the moisture and make the Pão de Queijo puff up nicely.</li>
        <li>Don't overcrowd the baking sheet. Give the Pão de Queijo plenty of space to rise in the oven.</li>
